# 🎯 Hands-On Tutorial: Learn by Doing

## 📚 Overview
This tutorial will teach you the exact techniques I used, with practical exercises you can do yourself.

## 🚀 Exercise 1: Environment Analysis

### **What I Did**
When you said "changes not showing," I immediately checked your environment.

### **Try This Yourself**
```bash
# Step 1: Check where you are
pwd

# Step 2: List what's in your current directory
ls -la

# Step 3: Look for specific file types
find . -name "*.js" -type f | head -5
find . -name "package.json" -type f

# Step 4: Check if any Node.js processes are running
ps aux | grep node
```

### **What to Look For**
- Are you in the right directory?
- Do you see the expected files?
- Are there any processes running?

## 🔍 Exercise 2: Process Debugging

### **What I Did**
I discovered your servers weren't running by checking processes and ports.

### **Try This Yourself**
```bash
# Step 1: Check what's running on common ports
netstat -an | grep -E "(3000|5000|8000)"

# Step 2: Look for Node.js processes
ps aux | grep -E "(node|react|npm)"

# Step 3: Check if a port is being used
lsof -i :3000
lsof -i :5000

# Step 4: Test if a service is responding
curl -s http://localhost:3000 || echo "Port 3000 not responding"
curl -s http://localhost:5000 || echo "Port 5000 not responding"
```

### **Exercise Challenge**
Start your portfolio project and verify both servers are running:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd server && npm start &

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
cd client && npm start &

# Terminal 3: Verify both are running
ps aux | grep -E "(node|react)"
netstat -an | grep -E "(3000|5000)"
```

## 📁 Exercise 3: File System Investigation

### **What I Did**
I discovered you were in the wrong directory by comparing paths.

### **Try This Yourself**
```bash
# Step 1: Create a test scenario
mkdir -p ~/test-project/client
mkdir -p ~/test-project/server
echo "console.log('Hello from client')" > ~/test-project/client/app.js
echo "console.log('Hello from server')" > ~/test-project/server/index.js

# Step 2: Practice navigation
cd ~/test-project
pwd
ls -la

# Step 3: Check subdirectories
ls -la client/
ls -la server/

# Step 4: Find files recursively
find . -name "*.js" -type f
```

### **Exercise Challenge**
Create a function to quickly check project structure:
```bash
# Add this to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
check_project() {
    echo "📍 Current directory: $(pwd)"
    echo "📁 Contents:"
    ls -la
    echo "🔍 JavaScript files:"
    find . -name "*.js" -type f | head -10
    echo "📦 Package.json files:"
    find . -name "package.json" -type f
}
```

## 🌐 Exercise 4: Network Testing

### **What I Did**
I tested your API endpoints to verify connectivity.

### **Try This Yourself**
```bash
# Step 1: Test basic connectivity
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Step 2: Test with better error handling
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/health || echo "❌ API not responding"

# Step 3: Test with verbose output
curl -v http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Step 4: Test different endpoints
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/portfolio | head -100
```

### **Exercise Challenge**
Create a health check script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as health_check.sh

check_endpoint() {
    local url=$1
    local name=$2
    
    if curl -s --max-time 5 "$url" > /dev/null; then
        echo "✅ $name is running"
    else
        echo "❌ $name is not responding"
    fi
}

echo "🔍 Health Check Report"
echo "====================="
check_endpoint "http://localhost:3000" "Frontend"
check_endpoint "http://localhost:5000" "Backend API"
check_endpoint "http://localhost:5000/api/health" "Health Endpoint"
```

## 🐛 Exercise 5: Problem-Solving Pattern

### **What I Did**
I followed a systematic approach to solve each issue.

### **Try This Yourself**
Practice the 5-step debugging process:

```bash
# Step 1: REPRODUCE the problem
# Try to make the error happen again

# Step 2: ISOLATE the issue
# Test individual components

# Step 3: HYPOTHESIZE the cause
# Based on symptoms, guess what's wrong

# Step 4: TEST the hypothesis
# Make minimal changes to test your theory

# Step 5: VERIFY the fix
# Make sure the solution actually works
```

### **Exercise Challenge**
Debug this intentionally broken setup:
```bash
# Create broken project
mkdir ~/broken-project
cd ~/broken-project
echo '{"name": "broken", "scripts": {"start": "node server.js"}}' > package.json
echo 'console.log("Server running on port " + process.env.PORT || 3000);' > server.js

# Now debug it using the 5-step process
npm start
# It will fail - use the methodology to fix it
```

---

## 📋 Exercise 6: Documentation Practice

### **What I Did**
I documented every step and solution for future reference.

### **Try This Yourself**
Create your own development log:
```bash
# Create a daily log
echo "# Development Log - $(date)" > ~/dev-log.md
echo "" >> ~/dev-log.md
echo "## Issues Encountered" >> ~/dev-log.md
echo "## Solutions Found" >> ~/dev-log.md
echo "## Commands Used" >> ~/dev-log.md
echo "## Next Steps" >> ~/dev-log.md
```

### **Exercise Challenge**
Document your problem-solving process:
```markdown
# Problem: [Description]
## Symptoms:
- What exactly is happening?
- What error messages do you see?

## Investigation:
- What commands did you run?
- What did you discover?

## Solution:
- What fixed the problem?
- Why did this work?

## Prevention:
- How can you avoid this in the future?
- What will you do differently?
```

## 🔄 Exercise 7: Git Workflow

### **What I Did**
I set up version control and pushed code to GitHub.

### **Try This Yourself**
```bash
# Step 1: Initialize a test repository
mkdir ~/git-practice
cd ~/git-practice
git init

# Step 2: Create and commit files
echo "# My Test Project" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Step 3: Check status and log
git status
git log --oneline

# Step 4: Create and switch branches
git checkout -b feature-branch
echo "New feature" > feature.txt
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Step 5: Merge back to main
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

### **Exercise Challenge**
Practice the workflow I used:
```bash
# 1. Make changes
echo "Updated content" > file.txt

# 2. Stage changes
git add file.txt

# 3. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Update file with new content"

# 4. Push to remote
git push origin main
```

## 🚀 Exercise 8: Deployment Preparation

### **What I Did**
I created deployment configurations and tested the build process.

### **Try This Yourself**
```bash
# Step 1: Create deployment config
cat > netlify.toml << 'EOF'
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
EOF

# Step 2: Test build process
npm run build
ls -la build/

# Step 3: Test production server
npm start
curl -s http://localhost:5000
```

### **Exercise Challenge**
Create a deployment checklist:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deployment-check.sh

echo "🚀 Deployment Checklist"
echo "======================="

# Check 1: All files present
echo "📁 Checking files..."
[[ -f "package.json" ]] && echo "✅ package.json" || echo "❌ package.json missing"
[[ -f "netlify.toml" ]] && echo "✅ netlify.toml" || echo "❌ netlify.toml missing"

# Check 2: Build works
echo "🔨 Testing build..."
npm run build && echo "✅ Build successful" || echo "❌ Build failed"

# Check 3: Git status
echo "📋 Git status..."
git status --porcelain && echo "❌ Uncommitted changes" || echo "✅ All changes committed"
```

## 🎯 Practice Project: Build Your Own

### **Final Challenge**
Create a simple project from scratch using all the techniques:

```bash
# Step 1: Create project structure
mkdir ~/my-practice-project
cd ~/my-practice-project
mkdir client server

# Step 2: Initialize packages
cd client && npm init -y
cd ../server && npm init -y

# Step 3: Create basic files
echo 'console.log("Frontend starting...");' > client/app.js
echo 'console.log("Backend starting...");' > server/index.js

# Step 4: Set up Git
cd ..
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"

# Step 5: Apply all the debugging techniques
# - Check processes
# - Test connectivity
# - Document everything
# - Create deployment configs
```
